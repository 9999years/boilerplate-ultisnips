# ultisnips-boilerplate

ultisnips-boilerplate is a packaging of [Noah Frederick’s post on using
ultisnips for templating][nfrederick]. He used it with Projectionist too, but I
don’t really need that so I didn’t care to include it.

# Usage

Create mappings for `_skel` or whatever you set
`g:ultisnips_boilerplate_skel_trigger` to.
