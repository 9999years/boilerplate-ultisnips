# boilerplate-ultisnips

boilerplate-ultisnips is a packaging of [Noah Frederick’s post on using
ultisnips for templating][nfrederick]. He used it with Projectionist too, but I
don’t really need that so I didn’t care to include it.

# Installation

You can use Vundle if you’d like or whatever else. It depends on [SirVer’s
Ultisnips][ultisnips] though, so jot that down.

# Usage

Create mappings for `_skel` or whatever you set
`g:boilerplate_ultisnips_skel_trigger` to.
